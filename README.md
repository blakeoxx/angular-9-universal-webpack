# Angular 9 Universal and Webpack test project

This project uses the [Tour of Heroes Universal sample project](https://v9.angular.io/guide/universal) as a base.

I'm attempting to install and configure webpack to bundle the server. Useful commands:

- **npm run build:ssr**: Builds the client and server distributables.
- **npm run serve:ssr**: Runs the application's Node/Express server. Access the application via http://localhost:4000.
- **npm run webpack:server**: Bundles the server with webpack. Run this after building the client and server distributables.
- **npm run serve:webpack**: Runs the application's Node/Express webpack server bundle. Access the application via http://localhost:4000.
